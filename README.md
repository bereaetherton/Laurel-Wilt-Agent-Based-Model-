#distance.xlsx is a 1132x1132 matrix with the geodesic distances between groves

#av.centers.xlsx is a matrix containing data from the Miami avocado groves

#Download these two files, and run through the script ABMgit.R

#some notes or TO-DOs:

#1. this is hardcoded for this data specifically

#My next steps are to make it so that you can read in a distance matrix and simulate management strategies

#2. I also am working on incorperating carrots and sticks

#they are not yet present in this simulation


#3. if all things go well with the HiPerGator, I will create a function that repeats this process over multiple simualtions

#this step should be easy (praying all things go well with the HiPG

#Happy Simulating :)

EDITS:

(04/02/21): Diseased trees are cleared out at every new year; previously dead trees remained in a grove until the end of the simulation or until the grove has died completley
